This is a repository for text mining scripts that I used for a friend's PhD thesis. We are trying to analyse sermons to explore patterns, how a priest reacted to the socio-political environment during the second half of the 20th century in Hungary. The script is still a work-in-progress, the aim of this repo is to share the code, approach and the Hungarian NLP tools used during the process. I believe this is a unique research area and the tools needed for such work only became available this year. Please feel free to use the Python code and the example file.

DISCLAIMER: The code is provided AS IS, it might not behave the way implied by the comments in the file. I plan to verify it all and consolidate everything into a paper in the coming months, but until then there's absolutely no guarantee that the code will work as indended and generate reproducible results. Feel free to use it, but you are on your own.
